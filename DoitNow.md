# Trying Mind Flow and Focus on Now

##  Set priority for tasks
    1. Test Driven first
**2019-1-21**
    1. write test files with pytest
    2. modeling TDX binary files to tag the high and low price or buy/sell indicator

### Issues and bugs:
    1. The positon where to launch python /or pytest execution in parent/up directoris affects
    the results and wrongly evaluating the relative path in the child directoris
    2. workaround fixed , launch/run in the same directoris , repairing the settings
      2.1 spacevim 
      2.2 vscode
